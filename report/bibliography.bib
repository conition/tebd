	abstract = {The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm pioneered by Steven White in 1992 is a variational optimization algorithm that physicists use to find the ground states of Hamiltonians of quantum many-body systems in low dimensions. But DMRG is more than a useful numerical method, it is a framework that brought together ideas from theoretical condensed matter physics and quantum information, enabling advances in other fields such as quantum chemistry and the study of dissipative systems. It also fostered the development and widespread use of tensor networks as mathematical representations of quantum many-body states, whose applications now go beyond quantum systems. Today, it is one of the most powerful and widely used methods for simulating strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. Six researchers discuss the early history of DMRG and the developments it spurred over the past three decades.},

@article{Barker:1979aa,
	abstract = {A new Monte Carlo method for problems in quantum‐statistical mechanics is described. The method is based on the use of iterated short‐time Green's functions, for which ''image''approximations are used. It is similar to the use of Feynman or Wiener path integrals but with a modification to take account of hard‐core boundary conditions. It is applied to two one‐dimensional test problems: that of a single particle in a hard‐walled box and that of two hard particles in a hard‐walled box. For these test problems, the results are in excellent agreement with exact quantum‐mechanical results both at high temperatures (near the classical limit) and at very low temperatures such that essentially only the ground state is occupied. Generalizations to three‐dimensional systems, to many‐body systems, and to more realistic potentials are discussed briefly.},

@article{Hortensius:2021aa,
	abstract = {Magnonics is a research field complementary to spintronics, in which the quanta of spin waves (magnons) replace electrons as information carriers, promising lower dissipation1--3. The development of ultrafast, nanoscale magnonic logic circuits calls for new tools and materials to generate coherent spin waves with frequencies as high and wavelengths as short as possible4,5. Antiferromagnets can host spin waves at terahertz frequencies and are therefore seen as a future platform for the fastest and least dissipative transfer of information6--11. However, the generation of short-wavelength coherent propagating magnons in antiferromagnets has so far remained elusive. Here we report the efficient emission and detection of a nanometre-scale wavepacket of coherent propagating magnons in the antiferromagnetic oxide dysprosium orthoferrite using ultrashort pulses of light. The subwavelength confinement of the laser field due to large absorption creates a strongly non-uniform spin excitation profile, enabling the propagation of a broadband continuum of coherent terahertz spin waves. The wavepacket contains magnons with a shortest detected wavelength of 125 nm that propagate into the material with supersonic velocities of more than 13 km s--1. This source of coherent short-wavelength spin carriers opens up new prospects for terahertz antiferromagnetic magnonics and coherence-mediated logic devices at terahertz frequencies.},
